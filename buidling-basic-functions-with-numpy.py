##Exercise: Build a function that returns the sigmoid of a real number x. Use math.exp(x) for the exponential function.
import math

def basic_sigmoid(x):
  s = 1/(1+math.exp(-x))
  return s
 
##Exercise: Implement the sigmoid function using numpy.
# GRADED FUNCTION: sigmoid

import numpy as np # this means you can access numpy functions by writing np.function() instead of numpy.function()

def sigmoid(x):
    """
    Compute the sigmoid of x

    Arguments:
    x -- A scalar or numpy array of any size

    Return:
    s -- sigmoid(x)

    s = 1/(1+np.exp(-x))
    ### END CODE HERE ###

    ##Exercise: Implement the function sigmoid_grad() to compute the gradient of the sigmoid function with respect to its input x. The formula is:
sigmoid_derivative(x)=σ′(x)=σ(x)(1−σ(x))

# GRADED FUNCTION: sigmoid_derivative
import numpy as np


def sigmoid_derivative(x):
    """
    Compute the gradient (also called the slope or derivative) of the sigmoid function with respect to its input x.

    x -- A scalar or numpy array

    ##Exercise: Implement image2vector() that takes an input of shape (length, height, 3) and returns a vector of shape (length*height*3, 1). For example, if you would like to reshape an array v of shape (a, b, c) into a vector of shape (a*b,c) you would do:

v = v.reshape((v.shape[0]*v.shape[1], v.shape[2])) # v.shape[0] = a ; v.shape[1] = b ; v.shape[2] = c

Exercise: Implement normalizeRows() to normalize the rows of a matrix. After applying this function to an input matrix x, each row of x should be a vector of unit length (meaning length 1).

    ##Exercise: Implement a softmax function using numpy. You can think of softmax as a normalizing function used when your algorithm needs to classify two or more classes. You will learn more about softmax in the second course of this specialization.
